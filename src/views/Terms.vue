                ArbStore, the legal entity described in <router-link to="/">arbstore.org</router-link>,
                supports cross-border trade and services with arbitration for
                P2P crypto payments by facilitating dispute resolution .
                ArbStore links parties who have entered a transaction that might
                eventually result in a commercial or legal dispute (the
                <i>“Parties”</i>) with arbitrators for the resolution of their
                disputes via smart contracts. For the purpose of these Terms and
                Conditions, arbitration means the online dispute resolution
                service facilitated by ArbStore and regulated by the terms of
                this Terms and Conditions and the terms described in section
                <i>“User guide for contracts with arbitration”</i> section in
                ArbStore’s page (<router-link to="/guide">arbstore.org/guide</router-link>) (the
                <i>“Guide”</i>). To the extent permitted by public policy,
                arbitration facilitated by ArbStore is not subject to any other
                arbitration rules, conventions or treaties.

            </li>

            <li>
              The Parties
              <p>
                The Parties wish to enter an online transaction using a smart
                contract with arbitration (the <i>“Transaction”</i>) and, should
                they have a dispute (the <i>“Dispute”</i>), resolve it in
                accordance with the Guide. Accordingly, the buyer in the
                Transaction agrees to deposit the transaction funds, in
                cryptocurrency, (the <i>“Transaction Amount”</i>) in a Smart
                Contract created by the Parties for the Transaction, in escrow,
                pending satisfactory completeness of the Transaction.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Parties appoint an arbitrator out of those listed on
                ArbStore’s website (the “Arbitrator”) to resolve the potential
                Dispute. The Parties are responsible to select an Arbitrator
                who, according to the Arbitrator’s description in ArbStore, is
                qualified or has the adequate level of expertise required to
                solve the potential Dispute. The Parties are recommended to
                reach out and confirm directly with the Arbitrator that he/she
                has the adequate qualifications or level of expertise to resolve
                the potential Dispute. The Arbitrator may charge an additional
                fee for this consultation.
              </p>

              <p>
                If the selected Arbitrator does not feel that he/she has the
                right qualification or level of expertise, the Arbitrator may
                decline the appointment and the Parties shall select another
                Arbitrator within ArbStore or find another way of concluding
                their contract with another dispute resolution method.
              </p>
              <p>
                By selecting the Arbitrator, the Parties agree to the
                Arbitrator’s fees and other terms described in the Arbitrator’s
                profile.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Escrow
              <p>
                The Transaction Amount will be kept in escrow, in the smart
                contract, by the Parties until the Transaction is satisfactorily
                completed, in which case the Parties shall release the
                Transaction Amount from the smart contract to their
                counterparty, and the seller shall get paid, or the buyer shall
                get refunded, in accordance with the Guide. If the Dispute
                arises, the Arbitrator will resolve the Dispute and will make
                the corresponding funds available to the winning party.
              </p>
              <p>
                Neither ArbStore nor the Arbitrator will be holding the
                Transaction Amount on behalf of the Parties, nor will they
                maintain the Transaction Amount or any other funds in custody
                for the Parties
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Arbitrators
              <p>
                The Arbitrator is either a legal professional or has technical
                or commercial knowledge that allows him/her to resolve legal,
                technical or commercial disputes. The Arbitrator in ArbStore can
                also be a legal entity composed of several real persons and
                represented by a single person or a group of persons (via a
                multi-signature wallet).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Arbitrator has been admitted to join the ArbStore
                arbitrators’ cast. Should the Dispute arise, the party claiming
                the breach (the <i>“Claimant”</i>) may instruct the Arbitrator
                to resolve the dispute.
              </p>
              <p>
                Arbitrators shall keep their profile in ArbStore updated, true
                and accurate at all times.
              </p>
              <p>
                Arbitrations may review their proposed pricing in ArbStore at
                any time but they shall respect the fees that were active during
                creation of the disputed contract.
              </p>
              <p>
                No other third parties shall be included in these Terms and
                Conditions unless prior written consent between the parties has
                been obtained.
              </p>
              <p>
                Arbitrators shall remove themselves from the Arbitrators’ list
                if they expect to be unavailable from some time.
              </p>
              <p>
                ArbStore shall be entitled to remove Arbitrators from the
                Arbitrators’ list, at any time.

              Arbitration Process and Pleadings
              <p>
                Generally, the arbitration process, in equity or in law, will
                follow the steps described in ArbStore’s webpage. Arbitrators
                may change the process as they deem appropriate
              </p>

                The Parties declare that they do not have any common interest or
                relationship with the chosen Arbitrator that may bias or
                influence the Arbitrators’ judgment to resolve a potential
                Dispute.

              </p>
              <p>
                Arbitration fees, as indicated in the Arbitrator’s profile shall

            </li>

              Waiver
              <p>
                By entering these Terms and Conditions, the Parties commit to
                submit the Dispute to resolution by the Arbitrator. To the
                extent permitted by applicable laws and public policy, the
                Parties waive their rights to take the Dispute to a court of
                justice and to appeal the Arbitrator’s decision resolving the
                Dispute (the <i>“Award”</i>).
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              Confidentiality
              <p>
                Until the Award is issued, neither party may reveal any
                information pertaining to the Terms and Conditions or related to
                the Dispute or the arbitration proceedings publicly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the Award is issued, it will be registered in the Obyte
                direct acyclic graph (DAG). Details of the Transaction and the
                Dispute shall remain confidential. Such details may not be
                disclosed to third parties without written approval from both
                Parties, ArbStore and the Arbitrator.

              <p>
                The Arbitrator agrees to join ArbStore’s <router-link to="/privacy">Privacy Policy</router-link> as a
                data controller. The Parties grant consent to ArbStore and the
                Arbitrator to collect and treat their personal data in
                accordance with ArbStore’s <router-link to="/privacy">Privacy Policy</router-link> for the purposes of
                resolving the Dispute.
              </p>

            <li>
              Representations
              <p>
                The Parties represent that they have the legal capacity to enter
                into these Terms and Conditions and that the Transaction and its
                subject matter is legitimate and does not violate any applicable
                laws.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Arbitrator shall refuse to grant an Award should he/she
                suspect that the Parties have entered this Terms and Conditions
                in breach of this representation.

              Termination/Force majeure/Impossibility to provide the service
              <p>
                The Arbitrator’s obligation to resolve the Dispute will
                extinguish in case of force majeure, inability of the Arbitrator
                to deliver the Award, by any reason, or any other circumstance
                that makes resolution of the Dispute impossible (e.g. loss of
                keys).
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              Liabilities
              <p>
                ArbStore will be exempted from any liability arising from the
                Transaction or the resolution of the Dispute by the Arbitrator.
                ArbStore shall not be liable for any loss or damages caused by
                the Arbitrator to the Parties and by the Parties to each other
                and to the Arbitrator. ArbStore will make reasonable efforts to
                ensure that the smart contract and the dispute resolution
                process work smoothly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Should any of the Parties consider that the Arbitrator has not
                acted independently, diligently or in good faith, such party
                should communicate this to ArbStore and ArbStore shall initiate
                the corresponding inquiry and appoint a moderator in accordance
                with the Guide.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Parties shall be entitled to initiate legal action against
                the Arbitrator if the Arbitrator has acted in bad faith,
                conflict of interests, with negligence or in breach of his/her
                representations under these Terms and Conditions.
