              <p>
                Arbiters signup at arbstore.org by following the links on the
                website, verifying their real name online, sharing their
                attested (verified) real name with the ArbStore, and filling
                their contact and professional information on the website. This
                information must include email address, a link to the arbiter’s
                LinkedIn profile, a description of professional experience,
                areas of expertise and qualification the arbiter is willing to
                resolve disputes in, as well as the arbiter’s fees and
                timeframes for resolving disputes in the said areas.

                however ArbStore may review the new arbiters and delist them if
                they don’t meet ArbStore’s requirements, or reach out to the new
                arbiter and request additional information or suggest
                improvements to the arbiter profile.
