              <p>
                Our website collects a series of general data and information
                when a data subject or automated system calls up the website.
                This general data and information are stored in the server log
                files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used,
                (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the
                website from which an accessing system reaches our website
                (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and
                time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol
                address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the
                accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information
                that may be used in the event of attacks on our information
                technology systems. When using these general data and
                information, we do not draw any conclusions about the data
                subject (i.e. you). Rather, this information is needed to (1)
                deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the
                content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure
                the long-term viability of our information technology systems
                and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement
                authorities with the information necessary for criminal
                prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, we analyze
                anonymously collected data and information statistically, with
                the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of
                our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for
                the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server
                log files are stored separately from all personal data you may
                provide to us.
