            Arbstore ("Arbstore," "we," "us," or "our") is committed to

                  Personal Information: We may collect personal information such
                  as your name, email address, contact number, and any other
                  information you voluntarily provide to us when you use our

                  Usage Information: We may collect non-personal information

                  Contract information: We may collect information about your
                  contracts and their performance only in case you or your
                  counterparty appeals an arbiterâ€™s resolution to the Arbstore.
                  It remains private between you and your counterparty if no
                  dispute is initiated. In case of a dispute, the arbiter chosen
                  by you and your counterparty also gets the contract
                  information. Arbiters are bound by their own privacy policies.
                  We urge you to consult the privacy policy of your chosen
                  arbiter before signing a contract.
